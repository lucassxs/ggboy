# ggboy <img src="data-raw/hex-logo/ggboy-hex-logo.png" align="right" height="139"/>

## Introduction
`ggboy` is a retro-gaming fix in R. It seeks to emulate the original Game Boy (DMG-01) graphics for a supplied image. 

By default, images are aggregated to be 160 units wide and 144 units high (the original Game Boy screen aspect ratio) and made of 4 shades of green. 

All settings can be modified to adjust the output to the users requirements.

```{r}
library(ggboy)
```

`ggboy` comes with two built in matrices for demonstration purposes. 

* `rstats` - the R logo
* `hk` - a photo I took whilst on holiday in Hong Kong back in (2008)

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4*(144/160)}
ggboy(rstats)
```

An approximation of the Game Boy body can be added to the plot by setting `graphic = TRUE` (crop must also be set to TRUE). The font used for the buttons is [*NES Console Controller Font -  MrShrike*](https://www.deviantart.com/mrshrike/art/NES-Console-Controller-Font-141383845).

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5, dpi=500}
patchwork::wrap_plots(ggboy(rstats, graphic = T), ggboy(hk, graphic = T))
```

## Tuning parameters
Varying `crop`, `ncols` and `res` allows for customisation of the final output. Setting `res = NULL` uses the maximum horizontal resolution (after cropping if `crop = TRUE`)
```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
patchwork::wrap_plots(
  ggboy(hk),
  ggboy(hk, res=80),
  ggboy(hk, crop=FALSE, ncols = 10),
  ggboy(hk, crop=FALSE, ncols = 30, res=NULL),
  nrow=2)
```

Change number of colours and colour gradient with `ncols` and `cols`
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5}
ggboy(hk, ncols = 10, cols=viridis::viridis(5))
```

## Changing aggregator
The function used to aggregate the binned pixels can be specified with `aggregator`
```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
library(ggplot2)

patchwork::wrap_plots(
  ggboy(hk, aggregator = mean) + labs(subtitle = "mean() (default)"),
  ggboy(hk, aggregator = median) + labs(subtitle = "median()"),
  ggboy(hk, aggregator = min) + labs(subtitle = "min()"),
  ggboy(hk, aggregator = max) + labs(subtitle = "max()"),
  ggboy(hk, aggregator = sd) + labs(subtitle = "sd()"),
  ggboy(hk, aggregator = function(x) x[1]) + labs(subtitle = "First element"),
  nrow=2)
```
